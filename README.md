### Contributors: *Anesu Masube and Aaron Childress*

# Goals

The goal of this analysis is to gain a deeper understanding of variables that affect achieving the fastest times in men's sprints with a case study of over 3000 of the fastest times recorded since 1964 for 100m Men's races. We tested whether wind and age have any effect on achieving the fastest times.
